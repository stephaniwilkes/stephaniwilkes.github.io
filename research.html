<h1>Research</h1>

<h5>Topic:</h5>
<a href="/files/documents/StephaniWilkes_ActionResearchPaper.pdf"><p>Improving Self-Efficacy by Altering Failure Communication and Reflection Processes</p></a>

<h5>Audience:</h5>
<p>Adult-learners in professional- and formal-learning environments; Young-adults; Adults changing careers; Young-adults dealing with stress from poor standardized testing results</p>

<h5>Purpose:</h5>
<p>The purpose of my action research plan is to explore the connection between failure communication, self-efficacy, and motivation to pursue new learning activities.</p>


<h5>Situation:</h5>
<p>The problem I want to solve is a learner's perception of failure as a constant negative; and the learner's perception of success as a constant positive. The situation I want to improve is a learner's self-reflection techniques (in direct relation to failure and success).</p>

<h5>Influential Research and Theories:</h5>

<!-- Begin Cycle 1 -->
<h3>Cycle 1: Failure experience Communication</h3>

<h5>Problem:</h5>
<p>When discussing failure experiences, the learner used destructive self-talk such as "I am stupid", "I am a failure", and "I suck".</p>

<h5>Goal:</h5>
<p>Improve learner's failure communication.</p>

<h5>Actions:</h5>

<ul>
	<li>Conducting baseline, confidence evaluation <a href="http://bit.ly/1LsC92n"></a></li>
	<li>Maintaining transparent research dissemination practices</li>
	<li>stablishing boundaries for failure communication and self-talk</li>
	<li>Facilitating researcher-to-learner failure communication conversations</li>
	<li>Validating learner's hobbies</li>
	<li>Administering end of cycle evaluation</li>
</ul>

<h5>Researcher's End-of-Cycle Analysis</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Throughout the research, the learner began setting boundaries for failure communication when others used destructive failure communication.</li>
	<li>The learner seemed engaged when discussing failure in games, and how the failure was necessary to learn to play the game.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Learner's End-of-Cycle Analysis</h5>
<p><b>Q: </b>Actions taken in this cycle positively influenced me and my actions.</p>
<p><b>A: </b>Unsure</p>
<br>
<p><b>Q: </b>Why or why not?</p>
<p><b>A: </b>It is difficult to see the changes now I believe. There is not a huge appreciable difference, but there is some I think. It could simply be that I am just working still and have yet to be overly challenged. I think it is mostly in my mindset, which means something has to happen for me to really see if any changes in my actions are apparent.</p>

<div class="summary">
<h5>Cycle 1 Summary - What I learned</h5>
<p>What Happened?</p>
<p>The Learner was not consciously aware of the progress they were making; though, the progress was subtle. Throughout the research, the learner began setting boundaries for failure communication when others used destructive failure communication. For example, a sibling made negative comments about themselves, the Learner would correct them and offer alternatives for talking about it.</p>
<p>How did I react?</p>
<p> I did not reveal my observations of the user making changes to their vocabulary because the Learner made it a point to say that they did not think it was working.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p> I did not want to skew the research by influencing the Learner’s point of view.</p>

<!-- End Cycle 1 -->


<!-- Begin Cycle 2 -->
<h3>Cycle 2: Poor self-efficacy reflection processes</h3>

<h5>Problem:</h5>
<p>When presented with complicated or overwhelming situations, the learner projected low, selfefficacy.</p>

<h5>Goal:</h5>
<p>Improve the learner's self-efficacy and motivation to persevere when they encounter problems or failures during their first term at a new school.</p>

<h5>Actions:</h5>

<ul>
	<li>Conducting baseline, confidence evaluation</li>
	<li>Maintaining transparent research dissemination practices</li>
	<li>Facilitating researcher-to-learner, selfefficacy reflection conversations</li>
	<li>Reinforcing failure communication boundaries</li>
	<li>Connecting learner's self-efficacy inhobby to self-efficacy in learning</li>
	<li>Administering end of cycle evaluation</li>
</ul>


<h5>Researcher's End-of-Cycle Analysis</h5>
<ul>
	<li>The learner initiated the necessary research to solve the issue when faced with a complicated and overwhelming educational situation that historically caused depression or anxiety.</li>
	<li>The self-efficacy that occurred after the issue was resolved was positive and future-focused. There were no signs of debilitating anxiety or depression.</li>
	<li>The learner made comments about feeling more confident and initiated conversation without prompting.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Learner's End-of-Cycle Analysis</h5>
<p><b>Q: </b>Actions taken in this cycle positively influenced me and my actions.</p>
<p><b>A: </b>Agree</p>
<br>
<p><b>Q: </b>Why or why not?</p>
<p><b>A: </b>Even though school didn't go quite as expected, I didn't lose heart like I would have before. I could tell I felt more confident and didn't get so upset when something happened this quarter compared to the past.</p>

<!-- Begin  Summary 2 -->
<div class="summary">
<h5>Cycle 2 Summary - What I learned</h5>
<p>What Happened?</p>
<p>The Learner started at a new school, and the first two weeks were frustrating for the Learner. They missed assignments because, as a new student, the Learner did not have the necessary information to find the assignment information – or even know there was an assignment – that was due on the first day of class. Toward the middle of the quarter, the Learner made the decision to drop the class that had caused issues from the first day with a plan to reenroll and start fresh the next quarter. Normally, the Learner would have been depressed, anxious, and full of self-doubt; however, the Learner made the decision with confidence and without negative failure communication. The Learner used positive failure experience communication to identify the source of frustration and problem solve.</p>
<p>How did I react?</p>
<p>I offered emotional assistance, provided feedback when the Learner asked questions, and let the Learner discuss the situation as often as necessary.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Allowing the Learner the ability to discuss the situation as often as they wanted seemed to help the Learner feel more confident and justified in the decision to drop the class.</p>

<!-- Begin Cycle 3 -->
<h3>Cycle 3: Lack of motivation to pursue learning activities</h3>

<h5>Problem:</h5>
<p>The learner lacks motivation to pursue new or challenging learning activities in- and outside of the formal classroom.</p>

<h5>Goal:</h5>
<p> The learner will maintain improved self-confidence and explore activities outside of their comfort zone.</p>

<h5>Actions:</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Conducting baseline, confidence evaluation</li>
	<li>Maintaining transparent research dissemination practices</li>
	<li>Reinforcing failure communication boundaries and positive self-efficacy reflection processes</li>
	<li>Researching and encouraging the pursuit of new learning activities related to career or personal interests</li>
	<li>Administering end of cycle evaluation</li>
</ul>

<h5>Researcher's End-of-Cycle Analysis</h5>
<p><i>Per Learner's request, Cycle 3 was cancelled</i></p>

<h5>Learner's End-of-Cycle Analysis</h5>
<p><i>Per Learner's request, Cycle 3 was cancelled</i></p>

<!-- Begin  Summary 3 -->
<div class="summary">
<h5>Cycle 3 Summary - What I learned</h5>
<p>What Happened?</p>
<p>The Learner requested that I cancel Cycle 3 due to personal reasons associated with a family medical emergency. However, Cycle 3 did garner some results. The Learner reported that they had made the decision to drop out of college. They felt that the environment, due to its lack of relevancy and project-based learning, did not suite their academic needs. The Learner reported that they are planning to teach themselves the skills required to pursue their dream career; furthermore, the Learner reported feeling much more confident about the situation without having to worry about school.</p>
<p>How did I react?</p>
<p>Out of respect for the Learner, I cancelled any formal activities I had planned for Cycle 3; however, I did ask the Learner to report on any information they were willing to share after making their decision to cancel the remaining cycle.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>I wanted to remain true to the student-centered aspect of my research.</p>
