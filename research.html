<h1>Research</h1>

<h5>Topic:</h5>
<p>The Role of Failure Communication and Self-Efficacy in Intrinsically Motivated Learning Actions</p>

<h5>Audience:</h5>
<p>Adult-learners in professional- and formal-learning environments; Young-adults; Adults changing careers; Young-adults dealing with stress from poor standardized testing results</p>

<h5>Purpose:</h5>
<p>The purpose of my action research plan is to explore the connection between failure communication, self-efficacy, and motivation to pursue new learning activities.</p>


<h5>Situation:</h5>
<p>The problem I want to solve is a learner's perception of failure as a constant negative; and the learner's perception of success as a constant positive. The situation I want to improve is a learner's self-reflection techniques (in direct relation to failure and success).</p>

<h5>Influential Research and Theories:</h5>
<p>(full list in progress)</p>

<ul>
	<li><i>Don't Bother Me Mom -- I'm Learning!</i>, a book written by Marc Prensky</li>
	<li><i>What Games have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy</i>, a book written by James Paul Gee</li>
	<li><i>Reality is Broken: Why Games Make Us Better and How They Can Change the World</i>, a book written by Jane McGonigal</li>
	<li><i>The Book of Learning and Forgetting</i>, a book written by Frank Smith</li>
	<li><i>Why Self-Esteem Hurts Learning But Self-Confidence Does The Opposite</i>, written by Saga Briggs on Saturday, July 5, 2014 on OpenColleges.edu.au.</li>
</ul>

<!-- Begin Cycle 1 -->
<h3>Cycle 1: Failure experience Communication</h3>

<h5>Problem:</h5>
<p>When discussing failure experiences, the learner used destructive self-talk such as "I am stupid", "I am a failure", and "I suck".</p>

<h5>Goal:</h5>
<p>Improve learner's failure communication.</p>

<h5>Actions:</h5>

<ul>
	<li>Conducting baseline, confidence evaluation <a href="http://bit.ly/1LsC92n"></a></li>
	<li>Maintaining transparent research dissemination practices</li>
	<li>stablishing boundaries for failure communication and self-talk</li>
	<li>Facilitating researcher-to-learner failure communication conversations</li>
	<li>Validating learner's hobbies</li>
	<li>Administering end of cycle evaluation</li>
</ul>

<h5>Researcher's End-of-Cycle Analysis</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Throughout the research, the learner began setting boundaries for failure communication when others used destructive failure communication.</li>
	<li>The learner seemed engaged when discussing failure in games, and how the failure was necessary to learn to play the game.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Learner's End-of-Cycle Analysis</h5>
<p><b>Q: </b>Actions taken in this cycle positively influenced me and my actions.</p>
<p><b>A: </b>Unsure</p>
<br>
<p><b>Q: </b>Why or why not?</p>
<p><b>A: </b>It is difficult to see the changes now I believe. There is not a huge appreciable difference, but there is some I think. It could simply be that I am just working still and have yet to be overly challenged. I think it is mostly in my mindset, which means something has to happen for me to really see if any changes in my actions are apparent.</p>

<!-- End Cycle 1 -->


<!-- Begin Cycle 2 -->
<h3>Cycle 2: Poor self-efficacy reflection processes</h3>

<h5>Problem:</h5>
<p>When presented with complicated or overwhelming situations, the learner projected low, selfefficacy.</p>

<h5>Goal:</h5>
<p>Improve the learner's self-efficacy and motivation to persevere when they encounter problems or failures during their first term at a new school.</p>

<h5>Actions:</h5>

<ul>
	<li>Conducting baseline, confidence evaluation</li>
	<li>Maintaining transparent research dissemination practices</li>
	<li>Facilitating researcher-to-learner, selfefficacy reflection conversations</li>
	<li>Reinforcing failure communication boundaries</li>
	<li>Connecting learner's self-efficacy inhobby to self-efficacy in learning</li>
	<li>Administering end of cycle evaluation</li>
</ul>


<h5>Researcher's End-of-Cycle Analysis</h5>
<ul>
	<li>The learner initiated the necessary research to solve the issue when faced with a complicated and overwhelming educational situation that historically caused depression or anxiety.</li>
	<li>The self-efficacy that occurred after the issue was resolved was positive and future-focused. There were no signs of debilitating anxiety or depression.</li>
	<li>The learner made comments about feeling more confident and initiated conversation without prompting.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Learner's End-of-Cycle Analysis</h5>
<p><b>Q: </b>Actions taken in this cycle positively influenced me and my actions.</p>
<p><b>A: </b>Agree</p>
<br>
<p><b>Q: </b>Why or why not?</p>
<p><b>A: </b>Even though school didn't go quite as expected, I didn't lose heart like I would have before. I could tell I felt more confident and didn't get so upset when something happened this quarter compared to the past.</p>
<!-- End Cycle 2 -->


<!-- Begin Cycle 3 -->
<h3>Cycle 3: Lack of motivation to pursue learning activities</h3>

<h5>Problem:</h5>
<p>The learner lacks motivation to pursue new or challenging learning activities in- and outside of the formal classroom.</p>

<h5>Goal:</h5>
<p> The learner will maintain improved self-confidence and explore activities outside of their comfort zone.</p>

<h5>Actions:</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Conducting baseline, confidence evaluation</li>
	<li>Maintaining transparent research dissemination practices</li>
	<li>Reinforcing failure communication boundaries and positive self-efficacy reflection processes</li>
	<li>Researching and encouraging the pursuit of new learning activities related to career or personal interests</li>
	<li>Administering end of cycle evaluation</li>
</ul>
