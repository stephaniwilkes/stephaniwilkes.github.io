<h2>Focus: Learners With Low Self-Efficacy</h2>

<h4>Purpose</h4>
<p>The purpose of my action research plan is to improve low self-efficacy in adult learners.</p>


<h4>Situation</h4>
<p>The problem I want to solve is a learner's perception of failure as a constant negative; and the learner's perception of success as a constant positive. The situation I want to improve is a learner's self-reflection techniques (in direct relation to failure and success).</p>

<h4>Research Question</h4>
<p>My  research question is: How can a learner draw positive learning traits from failure experiences, and negative learning traits from successful experiences, by subjectively redefining failure and success.</p>

<h4>Background Research</h4>
<p>The resources that have helped me the most include:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Don't Bother Me Mom -- I'm Learning!</i>, a book written by Marc Prensky</li>
<li><i>What Games have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy</i>, a book written by James Paul Gee</li>
<li><i>Reality is Broken: Why Games Make Us Better and How They Can Change the World</i>, a book written by Jane McGonigal</li>
<li><i>The Book of Learning and Forgetting</i>, a book written by Frank Smith</li>
<li><i>Why Self-Esteem Hurts Learning But Self-Confidence Does The Opposite</i>, written by Saga Briggs on Saturday, July 5, 2014 on OpenColleges.edu.au.</li>
</ul>

<h4>My Action Cycles</h4>

<h5>Cycle 1: Failure</h5>

<h6>Cycle 1 Goal</h6>
<p>Alter the learner's perception and definition of failure. The learner will also change their failure reflection process to encourage positive failure-reflection.</p>

<h6>Actions</h6>
<p>The actions I took in Cycle 1 were:</p>

<ol>

<li>Introduce new definitions for, or ways of thinking about, failure. Present and define learning theories, and discuss these theories in a casual manner.</li>
<li>Compare failure and passive learning in video games to failure and passive learning in real life scenarios because video games create a safe space for failure, and - because the targeted learner self-identifies as a hardcore gamer - the learner quickly connected the lessons gained from failure in video games to the lessons gained from failure in real life.</li>
<li>Facilitate a natural, passive learning environment by discussing my active learning activities (research for school, writing assignments, etc.), and genuinely request help from the learner, in areas of learner expertise (symbolic logic, Boolean statements, etc.)</li>
<li>Maintain learner-researcher's natural community of practice (i.e., our lifelong partnership) by playing board games, trading new facts about common interests, and using best practices in interpersonal communication in arguments, debates, and discussions. </li>
<li>Listen to the <i> Reality is Broken</i> audio book together on road trips.</li>

</ol>

<h6>Artifacts</h6>

<ol>

<li>I have collected a recorded conversation where the learner identifies positive experiences with failure (defined in the semiotic domain of computer science education), and negative experiences with success (defined in the semiotic domain of video game play). </li>
<li>My literature review for my action research is a result of the community practice in action. I (in the role of researcher) called upon my spouse (in the role of learner), to assist me in clarifying the scope of my research, maintaining logical connections, and organizing my resources.</li>
<li>This cycle, I did not obtain a reflection journal from the learner. Due to the passive learning that occurred - therefore the passive occurrence of my first cycle - the learner did not record their reflections.</li>

</ol>

<h6>Evaluation</h6>
<p>I evaluated the outcomes of this cycle while clarifying the scope of my research. Though on accident, I discovered how the learner's idea of failure has changed since my graduate studies started five months ago (in July 2014). This cycle reinforced that learning happens passively as well as actively. As I shared my active learning process, the learner passively learned new ways to think about failure and learning.</p>

<p>	In consideration of the above mentioned evaluation, I plan to continue cycle 1 until early-January (when the learner returns to school). Cycle 2 will begin after the first week of classes to allow time to collect a baseline measurement of self-efficacy.</p>

<h5>Cycle 2: Self-Efficacy</h5>
<p>	My current thoughts on my second cycle of action depend on the baseline data I will collect after the first week of the learner's first term at their new school. The baseline data will act as a control to measure how encountered failures and success affect the learner's self-efficacy in the semiotic domain of formal education. In consideration of the above mentioned, my second cycle actions are as follows:</p>

<h6>Cycle 2 Goal</h6>
<p>Improve the learner's self-confidence and motivation to persevere when they encounter problems or failures during their first term at a new school.</p>

<h6>Actions</h6>
<ol>

<li>Identify instances of failure and passive learning in video games.</li>
<li>Introduce more obvious forms of positive reinforcements for perseverance.</li>
<li>Facilitate a natural, passive learning environment by discussing my active learning activities, and continue to request help from the learner, in areas of learner expertise.</li>
<li>Maintain natural community of practice by playing board games, trading new facts about common interests, and using best practices in interpersonal communication in arguments, debates, and discussions. </li>
<li>Introduce a self-efficacy scale and a resulting motivation-to-try scale, with the idea that the learner will identify a negative experience, measure their level of self-efficacy, and then measure their willingness (motivation) to continue with the task; and describe why they decided to stick with it or move on. The point of this being to create a visual connection between their willingness to complete a task based on their risks, rewards, failures, and successes experienced in the encounter.</li>

</ol>

<h6>Artifacts</h6>

<ol>

<li>Collection of recorded conversations throughout cycle 2.</li>
<li>Reflection journals (with the scales and descriptions).</li>
<li>Definitions of failure and success.</li>
<li>Journals with my observations.</li>

</ol>

<h6>Evaluation</h6>
<p>	I will evaluate the outcomes of this action by conducting an informal interview after finals week of the learner's school term. This evaluation will be recorded. I will also evaluate conversations not related to school, and compare them to pre-cycle conversations.</p>

<h5>Cycle 3: Motivation to Pursue Active Learning Activities</h5>
<p>	My current thoughts on my third cycle of action depend on the baseline data I will collect after the first week of the learner's second term at school. The baseline data will act as a control to measure the learner's self-efficacy and intrinsic motivation to continue attending school. In consideration of the above mentioned, my third cycle actions are as follows:</p>

<h6>Cycle 3 Goal</h6>
<p> The learner will maintain improved self-confidence and explore activities outside of their comfort zone.</p>

<h6>Actions</h6>
<ol>

<li>Compare self-efficacy from before cycle 1 to start of cycle 3.</li>
<li>Develop a mentee/mentor relationship (either in the role of mentee or mentor).</li>
<li>Encourage self-praise for perseverance (tapping into fiero). </li>
<li>Maintain natural community of practice by playing board games, trading new facts about common interests, and using best practices in interpersonal communication in arguments, debates, and discussions. </li>
<li>Continue using the self-efficacy scale and motivation-to-try scale to identify a negative experience, measure their level of self-efficacy, and then measure their willingness (motivation) to continue with the task; and describe why they decided to stick with it or move on.</li>

</ol>

<h6>Artifacts</h6>
<ol>

<li>Collection of recorded conversations throughout cycle 3.</li>
<li>Reflection journals (with the scales and descriptions).</li>
<li>Definitions of failure and success, analysis of pre-cycle self-efficacy and post-cycle self-efficacy, analysis of intrinsic motivation to continue in school.</li>
<li>Journals with my observations.</li>

</ol>

<h6>Evaluation</h6>
<p>	I will evaluate the outcomes of this action by conducting an informal interview after finals week of the learner's school term. This evaluation will be recorded. I will also evaluate conversations not related to school, and compare them to pre-cycle conversations.</p>
